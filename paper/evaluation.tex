\veronika{introduce preliminaries specific for measures here. they are not needed if you just read the paper to learn about the datasets...}

Evaluation tool to compute distances between logic programs:
 There are 2 (or more) types  of distances defined on logic programs
\begin{itemize}
    \item  distance between Herbrand interpretations 
    \item directly on rules (logic programs)  
\end{itemize}

we don't count auxiliary pred

the distances can be considered ``fuzzy'' in the sense that we consider facts with weights

\veronika{I think we should also compute measures they considered so far - like Hits@... AUC , ... -- and the discuss how the results vary}
