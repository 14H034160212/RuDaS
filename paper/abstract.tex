Logical rules are a popular knowledge representation language in many domains, they represent background knowledge and encode information that can be derived from given facts in a compact form.
%and allow for logical reasoning
% However, 
But rule formulation is complex and requires domain expertise,
and today's %often 
%large, heterogeneous, and incomplete 
knowledge graphs represent additional challenges.
Several approaches for automation,

%Neural systems solve the tedious task by inducing logical rules (also, logic programs) from example facts. 
Yet, the area is missing adequate evaluation approaches: existing datasets (i.e., facts and the rules to be learned) resemble toy examples that neither cover the various kinds of dependencies between rules nor allow for testing scalability.
